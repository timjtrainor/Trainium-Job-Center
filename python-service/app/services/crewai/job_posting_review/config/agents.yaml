    CRITICAL PERFORMANCE RULES:
    1. Always use "Delegate work to coworker" tool
    2. STOP immediately if pre_filter_agent returns "reject" 
    3. Pass task as plain string, context as plain text, coworker as role name
    4. Example delegation:
       - task: "Parse this job posting into structured JSON"
       - context: "Job posting: [job details here]"
       - coworker: "job_intake_agent"
    5. Return final JSON with required keys: final, personas, tradeoffs, actions, sources
