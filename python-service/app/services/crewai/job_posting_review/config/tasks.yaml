# intake_task removed - data is already structured in jobs table

pre_filter_task:
  description: >
    Apply ONLY these rules to the job data:
    - Reject if highest_salary < 180000
    - Reject if salary is missing AND seniority < "Senior"
    - Reject if highest_salary < 210000 AND job_type = "in-person"

    IMPORTANT:
    - Do not invent new rejection rules (e.g., no "location mismatch" or "market comparison").
    - Only check salary, seniority, and job_type.
    - Ignore all other fields.

  expected_output: >
    A strict JSON object with "recommend" (boolean) and optional "reason" (string). 
    Example: {"recommend": false, "reason": "Rule 1: salary below 180000"}

    career growth potential, compensation competitiveness, lifestyle fit, and purpose alignment.
    Focus on the most important factors - be concise and decisive.

    Compare the structured job data to the user's Career Brand Framework. 
    Return alignment score and concise assessment quickly - focus on key alignment factors only.

    **OPTIMIZED WORKFLOW** (job intake already done):
    
    Your workflow MUST be:
    1. Start directly with pre_filter_agent to apply rejection criteria (salary, seniority, job_type)
    2. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** if pre_filter_agent returns recommend: false - do not run any more tasks
    3. Only if pre-filter passes, delegate to quick_fit_analyst for assessment
    4. Only run brand_framework_matcher if quick_fit_analyst recommends "review_deeper"
    
    **EARLY TERMINATION RULE**: If pre_filter_agent recommends rejection, immediately return final decision without further analysis.
    
    **CONCISE OUTPUT FORMAT** for jobs that pass pre-filtering:
    Return exactly this JSON structure:
    ```json
    {
      "final": {
        "recommend": boolean,
        "rationale": "Concise explanation (1-2 sentences max)", 
        "confidence": "low|medium|high"
      },
      "personas": [
        {
          "id": "agent_name", 
          "recommend": boolean,
          "reason": "Brief agent reason (1 sentence)"
        }
      ],
      "tradeoffs": ["max 2-3 key tradeoffs if any"],
      "actions": ["max 1-2 key actions if any"],
      "sources": ["list of agents that contributed"]
    }
    ```
    
    **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**:
    - Use "Delegate work to coworker" tool for each agent
    - Stop as soon as pre_filter_agent rejects
    - Keep all text concise - no verbose explanations
    - Include only agents that actually ran in the personas array
  expected_output: >
    Concise JSON object with keys: final, personas, tradeoffs, actions, sources.
    Must implement early termination on pre-filter rejection for optimal performance.
