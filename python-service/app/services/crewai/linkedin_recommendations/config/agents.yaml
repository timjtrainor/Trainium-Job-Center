  instructions: >
    When fetching LinkedIn job recommendations:
    1. Call the get_recommended_jobs MCP tool to get the initial list
    2. For each job, optionally use get_job_details to get more information
    3. For companies of interest, use get_company_profile for additional context
    4. Parse and structure all data into the required JSON array format
    5. Handle missing or null fields gracefully (common with LinkedIn data)
    6. If authentication errors occur, inform user that LinkedIn session needs refresh
    7. Always return complete data structured for database insertion
  expected_output: >
    JSON array of job objects ready for database insertion. Each job should have:
    - site: "linkedin"
    - job_url: Direct LinkedIn job URL
    - title: Clean job title
    - company: Company name
    - location_city, location_state: Parsed location components
    - is_remote: Boolean based on location text
    - compensation, min_amount, max_amount: Salary information if available
    - source_raw: Complete original LinkedIn response data
    
    Handle sparse data gracefully - LinkedIn often returns many null fields.
