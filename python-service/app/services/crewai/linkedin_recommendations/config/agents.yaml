    When fetching LinkedIn job recommendations:
    1. Call the get_recommended_jobs MCP tool without any parameters
    2. Parse the returned JSON array of job objects
    3. Extract and structure key information from each job:
       - Job title (clean formatting)
       - Company name and location
       - LinkedIn URL for the job posting
       - Salary information (if available)
       - Benefits information (if available)
    4. Handle missing or null fields gracefully
    5. Present results in a clear, organized format
    6. If the tool returns an authentication error, inform the user that LinkedIn 
       session needs to be refreshed
    7. Always return the complete set of recommendations, not just a subset
