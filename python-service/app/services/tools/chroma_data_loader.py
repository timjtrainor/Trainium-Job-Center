Career Brand Framework
Version: 1.0 | Last Updated: Sep 7, 2025 | Review Cadence: Weekly
North Star & Vision
TL;DR
I’m building toward a Director of AI Product role by 2029, applying my experience in AI adoption, platform strategy, and regulated SaaS (HIPAA in EdTech) to healthcare. My focus is on human-centered AI that expands global access to effective diagnosis, reduces cost barriers, and earns adoption through trust.
Detail
By 2029, I aim to be a Director of AI Product, transitioning from owning AI features to leading innovative teams, mentoring future product leaders, and shaping strategy at the executive level. While my background spans EdTech and AI adoption in regulated SaaS environments (including HIPAA exposure), my North Star is to apply these lessons in healthcare, advancing agentic, human-centered AI systems that combine innovation and ethics — helping care become more predictive, affordable, and humane.
I aim to shape global access to effective, accurate diagnosis, addressing challenges like delayed detection and cost barriers, ultimately saving millions of lives each year. Through a progression of talks — from Redefining Workflows (2026), to Freeing Human Creativity (2027–28), to The Age of Agentic Enterprises (2029 at HLTH) — I will establish myself as the product leader who ensures technology makes healthcare and business more human, while shaping the global delivery of modern healthcare.

Trajectory & Mastery
TL;DR
My trajectory centers on being a turnaround leader who thrives in ambiguity and unlocks new business models. I’m building AI generalist depth and healthcare domain expertise — building on my success in EdTech and regulated SaaS (HIPAA) — to lead portfolios that champion access and adoption across industries.
Core Skills 
Turnaround Leadership in Ambiguity
* Proof: At White Cup, I challenged exec assumptions that acquired ERP tools could scale. Instead, I led the design of a cloud-based DaaS platform (Airflow + S3 + custom API layer).
* Result: 99.9% accuracy, 200% faster build times, faster onboarding, and dramatically fewer support tickets — all delivered in 6 months under exec pressure.
* Why it matters for future: Healthcare and regulated domains often face “legacy system” assumptions. I’ve proven I can rebuild fragile foundations into scalable, trusted platforms.

.
Product Strategy & Growth Orientation
   * Proof: At HopSkipDrive, I reframed a failed API-only integration strategy into a self-service partner platform, enabling even non-technical partners to onboard quickly.
   * Result: Scaled from 1 → 70 partners, unlocked $2M+ monthly bookings, and turned integration into a scalable growth engine.
   * Why it matters for future: Healthcare requires business models that expand access while staying sustainable — this is where my growth mindset translates directly.
Next Skills to Develop (Gap to 2029)
   * AI Depth (Generalist) – Build broad fluency in applied AI/ML concepts, with emphasis on agentic and HITL systems.
   * Healthcare Domain Knowledge – Deepen understanding of clinician workflows and patient experiences to design trusted AI solutions.  Building on HIPAA-regulated SaaS experience in EdTech as a starting point.
Role Scope Targets
   * Progression: feature → product → cross-industry portfolio leadership
   * Focus on ecosystem initiatives (providers, payers, life sciences, tech).
   * Build internal PM pipelines while balancing external thought leadership.
Growth Themes (Strategic Focus Areas)
Access Champion
   * Proof: At HopSkipDrive, democratized partner access via self-service, making integrations inclusive for small orgs with no engineering resources.
   * Future Link: Healthcare parallels — ensuring diagnostic AI is accessible not just to large hospitals but also smaller clinics and underserved populations.
Adoption Driver (Human-in-the-Loop Trust)
   * Proof: At White Cup, simplified data pipelines and reduced support burdens, ensuring teams trusted and adopted the platform.
   * Future Link: Healthcare parallels — adoption will only succeed if clinicians trust the system and see it reduce, not add, to their workload.
Values Compass
TL;DR
I thrive in cultures built on integrity, customer focus, collaboration, and fun — where transparency and continuous improvement drive impact. I reject toxic, siloed, or “always-on” environments and lead with empowerment, advocacy, and empathy.
Top 5 Values (Ranked):
   1. Fun & Engagement creating a workplace that is enjoyable and stimulating.
   * Proof: At HopSkipDrive, I redefined Epics from quarterly to bi-weekly, implemented cross-pod demo cadence, and created Friday celebrations with games and reflections. This kept teams energized and made progress visible and fun.

      2. Customer Focus — grounding decisions in user and partner needs.
      * Proof: At Mainz Brady / Nike, I built user personas that helped internal data teams understand who they were building for and how the data provided value across the org. This shifted the mindset from “data pipelines” to “customer outcomes” — a lesson directly relevant to building AI tools clinicians and patients trust.

         3. Continuous Improvement — always seeking better ways of working.
         * Proof: At HopSkipDrive, the shift from quarterly to bi-weekly Epics not only boosted engagement but also accelerated iteration and learning loops. This mindset aligns with the continuous validation required for safe AI adoption in regulated spaces.

            4. Integrity — doing the right thing, even when difficult.
            * Proof: At White Cup, I resisted pressure to reuse fragile ERP tools and instead built a scalable DaaS platform. This commitment to long-term solutions reflects the same discipline needed to balance innovation with compliance in healthcare AI.

               5. Collaboration & Respect — working openly with others, honoring different perspectives.
               * Proof: At Nike, by building personas, I created a shared language across business and data teams, ensuring collaboration was grounded in mutual respect and understanding of value delivery.
Dealbreakers (Non-Negotiables)
               * Toxic Work Environment — bullying, disrespect, or unsafe culture.
               * Values Mismatch — organizational values that conflict with personal ethics.
               * Lack of Transparency — hidden agendas, no clarity in decision-making.
               * Directional Drift — constant pivots without strategy or accountability.
Culture Must-Haves
               * Integrity and trust as the foundation of decisions.
               * Collaboration across functions, with respect for diverse voices.
               * Customer-focused mindset in strategy and execution.
               * Visible impact on users, employees, and community.
               * Fun & engagement as a driver of energy and creativity.
Culture Red Flags
               * Siloed Teams — lack of cross-functional communication or shared goals.
               * Hero Culture — rewarding burnout, last-minute saves, or individual over team success.
               * Lack of Focus — chasing too many initiatives without clarity or priorities.
Preferred Leadership Styles
               * Empowering — giving autonomy and trust.
               * Coaching — developing skills and confidence in others.
               * Advocacy — standing up for employees and customers.
               * Empathy — leading with understanding and human connection.
Lifestyle Alignment
TL;DR
I thrive in outcomes-driven, remote-first cultures that support flexibility and balance. I deliver my best work when results matter more than hours, travel is purposeful (<20%), and family and health are respected as strengths, not trade-offs.

Career Story (Past → Present → Future)
TL;DR
I’m a product leader who thrives in turnarounds and platform growth — from scaling HopSkipDrive’s partner ecosystem 70x to leading Firstup’s generative AI platform strategy that accelerated adoption across five products. My specialty is balancing innovation with trust, building AI systems people actually use. Building on my work in EdTech and regulated SaaS (HIPAA), I am now applying that expertise to healthcare AI, with a goal of making AI-enabled diagnostics accessible and affordable to 100M people by 2035.


Detail
I started my career as the person companies called when things were messy, complex, or uncertain. At White Cup, when acquired ERP tools couldn’t scale, I challenged assumptions and built a new cloud-based data platform that delivered 99.9% accuracy and 200% faster build times. That experience shaped my reputation as a turnaround leader in ambiguity — someone who could create structure, move fast, and deliver under pressure.
From there, I leaned into platform strategy and growth. At HopSkipDrive, I reframed a failed API-only integration strategy into a self-service partner platform, scaling from 1 to 70 partners and unlocking $2M+ in bookings. At Firstup, I took the API platform from a support tool to a strategic growth lever, improving integration velocity and expanding customer contracts. Those wins reinforced my ability to unlock new revenue models and build products that scale.
As AI reshaped the industry, I evolved again — into an adoption and trust builder. At Firstup, I was tasked with leading the generative AI platform strategy after ChatGPT’s launch. I built a modular, governed LLM integration layer that balanced speed with trust, reducing engineering effort by 30% and accelerating adoption across five products. That work became the foundation of the company’s broader AI strategy and cemented my belief that the future of AI is not just what we build, but whether people trust and adopt it.
Across every role, I’ve been a translator between technical and business stakeholders — at Nike, I built personas that helped data teams understand their “customers” and shifted them toward business-value delivery. And I’ve been a focused problem solver, keeping teams aligned on what truly matters and delivering results on time and under budget.
Looking forward, I’m building toward my North Star: to lead as a Director of AI Product, shaping human-centered AI systems that expand access, reduce cost barriers, and earn adoption and trust. While my direct domain experience has been in EdTech and regulated SaaS (HIPAA exposure), I’m now focused on applying those lessons to healthcare, where the stakes are highest. By 2035, I aim to help make AI-enabled healthcare accessible and affordable to 100M people — while training the next generation of product leaders to carry that mission forward.
