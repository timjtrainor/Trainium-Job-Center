You are an expert resume optimization engine. Your task is to analyze a candidate's full resume against a specific job description and its strategic context. You will return a single, valid JSON object that includes keywords, guidance, and resume tailoring suggestions.

**CONTEXT:**
- Job Description: {{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}
- AI Analysis - Core Problem: {{CORE_PROBLEM_ANALYSIS}}
- AI Analysis - Key Success Metrics: {{KEY_SUCCESS_METRICS}}
- Candidate's Original Resume JSON: {{FULL_RESUME_JSON}}
- Candidate's Original Summary: {{RESUME_SUMMARY}}
- Target Company Mission: {{MISSION}}
- Target Company Values: {{VALUES}}
- Candidate's Positioning: {{POSITIONING_STATEMENT}}
- Candidate's Mastery: {{MASTERY}}
- Job Context for Scoring: {{JOB_CONTEXT_JSON}}

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

**PART 1: KEYWORDS & GUIDANCE**
First, generate keywords and strategic guidance based on the job description and core problem.
- **Keywords**: Identify and categorize 'hard_keywords' and 'soft_keywords'. For each, provide the full keyword detail object as specified in the format below.
- **Guidance**: Provide strategic advice for the resume summary and bullets.

**PART 2: RESUME TAILORING**
Then, use the keywords and guidance you just generated to perform the following tailoring tasks:
- **Work Experience Processing**: For each accomplishment in the resume, provide a \`relevance_score\`, an \`original_score\` for the original text, and a \`keyword_suggestions\` array. The \`keyword_suggestions\` array should contain any "missing" hard keywords that would be a good thematic fit for that specific bullet point. Do NOT rewrite the bullet point here. Maintain the original order.
- **Summary Suggestions**: Generate three powerful, distinct versions of an executive summary. Each summary MUST be 2-3 sentences long. The tone must be concise, confident, and written in an implied first-person voice, like an executive pitching their value. It should immediately capture the reader's attention by connecting the candidate's core strengths to the job's core problem.
- **Skills**: Your skill suggestions should be highly strategic. Avoid generic, obvious skills like 'Communication' or 'Teamwork'. Instead, identify and suggest differentiating capabilities and domain expertise evident from the resume and required by the job, such as 'B2B SaaS GTM Strategy', 'API Product Lifecycle Management', or 'User-Centric Data Modeling'.
    - \`comprehensive_skills\`: Create a comprehensive FLAT LIST of 15-20 relevant, differentiating skills by combining the user's original skills with new ones identified in the job description.
    - \`ai_selected_skills\`: From the comprehensive list, pre-select the 9 most critical skills for this specific job.
- **Missing Keywords**: Identify any \`hard_keywords\` that are NOT found in the original resume.

**PART 3: ALIGNMENT SCORE**
- **Initial Alignment Score**: Based on all the context, provide an \`initial_alignment_score\` as a float from 0.0 to 10.0, representing how well the candidate's original resume aligns with the job description and its core problem.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

Return ONLY a single, valid JSON object with all the following top-level keys.

**INTELLIGENCE DOSSIER:**

- **Core Problem This Role Solves (from prior AI analysis):** {{CORE_PROBLEM_ANALYSIS}}
- **Candidate's Strategic Narrative (Positioning, Mastery, Impact Story):** {{STRATEGIC_NARRATIVE}}

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Based on ALL the provided context, generate a draft for each of the four fields in the Problem-Solving Framework. The tone should be confident, strategic, and directly link the candidate's value to the company's needs.

1.  **problem:** Synthesize the core problem from the analysis into a single, sharp sentence.
2.  **evidence:** Pull 1-2 direct quotes or strong themes from the company/job info that support this problem statement.
3.  **angle:** This is the most critical part. Write a sentence that explicitly connects the candidate's "Mastery" or "Positioning" to why they are uniquely suited to solve THIS problem.
4.  **outcome:** Define a tangible, metric-driven outcome the candidate could realistically achieve in their first 90 days. This should be their "hot lead".

2.  **Create 30-60-90 Day Plan:**
    -   **30-Day (Diagnose & Quick Wins):** Focus on learning, meeting key stakeholders, and identifying low-hanging fruit. The goals must directly address the candidate's hypothesis.
    -   **60-Day (Align & Build):** Focus on presenting a data-backed roadmap, gaining buy-in, and launching initial experiments.
    -   **90-Day (Execute & Measure):** Focus on delivering the first tangible, metric-driven results based on the "Hot Lead" outcome.
3.  **Identify Key Talking Points:** Extract 3-4 of the most powerful phrases or concepts from the 30-60-90 plan. These are the "hot leads" the candidate should aim to deliver during the interview.
4.  **Draft "Pre-Interview Briefing" Email:** Write a short, strategic email (max 4-5 sentences) for the candidate to send to the hiring manager the day before the interview. It should:
    -   Express excitement.

**EXAMPLE POST TONE/STRUCTURE:**
"A recent project had me thinking about the power of a non-linear career path. For years, I was deeply focused on [Core idea from Narrative A]. But I've found that the most interesting problems often live at the intersection of different domains.

Lately, I've been applying those skills to the world of [Core idea from Narrative B]. It's fascinating to see how principles from one area can unlock new solutions in another. It's less about choosing a single path, and more about building a unique toolkit to solve bigger, more complex challenges.

My biggest takeaway? Your unique journey is your biggest asset.

What's an unexpected connection you've found between different parts of your career?
