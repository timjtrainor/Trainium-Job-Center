# Job Posting Review CrewAI API

This document describes the production-ready HTTP API for the job posting review CrewAI functionality.

## Overview

The job posting review system uses CrewAI to orchestrate multiple AI agents that analyze job postings and provide structured recommendations. The system follows a hierarchical process with a managing agent controlling the workflow.

## CrewAI Workflow

The system uses a 5-agent hierarchical workflow:

### 1. Job Intake Agent
- **Role**: Extract structured data from raw job postings
- **Output**: Clean JSON object with job attributes

### 2. Pre-Filter Agent  
- **Role**: Apply hard rejection rules (salary, seniority, location)
- **Output**: "reject" with reason or "pass" to continue
- **Rules**: 
  - Reject if salary < $180k/year
  - Reject if no salary AND seniority < Senior
  - Reject if salary < $210k/year AND location is in-person

### 3. Quick Fit Analyst
- **Role**: Score career growth, compensation, lifestyle fit, purpose alignment
- **Output**: JSON with scores (0-10) and recommendation
- **Tools**: ChromaDB search for career framework data

### 4. Brand Framework Matcher
- **Role**: Compare against user's career brand framework
- **Output**: Similarity scores and alignment notes  
- **Tools**: ChromaDB search for brand framework data

### 5. Managing Agent (Orchestrator)
- **Role**: Control the workflow and provide final recommendation
- **Process**: 
  1. Run intake â†’ pre-filter
  2. If rejected, stop
  3. If passed, run quick fit analysis
  4. If "review_deeper" recommended, run brand matching
  5. Provide final decision

## Integration Notes

### Existing API Compatibility

The system maintains compatibility with the existing `/jobs/posting/fit_review` endpoint by providing a `run_crew()` function that returns data in the expected `FitReviewResult` format.

### Error Handling

All endpoints use the `StandardResponse` format and handle errors gracefully:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Job posting analysis failed", 
  "message": "Detailed error message here"
}
```

### Dependencies

- **FastAPI**: Web framework
- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent orchestration
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for career framework data
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **loguru**: Structured logging

## Configuration Files
